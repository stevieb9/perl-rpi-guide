Broad overview:
---------------

- very brief intro to the Pi, its capabilities, and overview of the features and
  limitations of the software

- a synopsis of what will be being taught, formats/conventions that will be used

- basic intro on creating and using a Pi object

- intro to the most basic part of the Pi, the GPIO

- examples of creating and using a GPIO pin at the most basic level (INPUT,
  OUTPUT, HIGH and LOW etc)

- intro and examples using advanced pin features (interrupts, PWM, pull up/down
  etc)

- workshop: using simple pin-based sensors and devices (LEDs, hygrometers,
  thermo-resistors, distance sensors etc)

- detailed overview of the communication mechanisms included (I2C, Serial, SPI
  etc)

- workshop: detailed overview of using the comms, starting very basic, leading
  into writing your own device/sensor modules using the software

- workshop: using an LCD and/or OLED screen to display things on it

- workshop: intro to and using Analog to Digital converters

- workshop: intro to and using Digital to Analog converters

- workshop: intro to and using Digital Potentiometers

- workshop: intro to and using shift registers (basic through to advanced usage)

- workshop: using a GPS module

- workshop: advanced uses: utilizing several ICs and sensors in much larger and
  more involved projects (probably put together a few of these)

- workshop: connecting to and using features of an Arduino with the Pi (over
  varying communication methods, including example Arduino sketches)

- how this software came about, and some basic information on the underlying
  parts that allow it to work

- extensive article on how I ensure the code is fully tested after each commit
  on a custom hardware test platform

- possibly some details/photos on some of my real life projects I use at home
  (my indoor grow room automation system for example)

- possibly a demo example of writing a web UI with jQuery to automate and
  provide a GUI of a basic project
